PPO-based Reinforcement Learning framework for automated trading of 18-Carat Gold in the Iranian market. Submitted to the 12th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR).
This repository presents a deep reinforcement learning framework for automated trading of 18-Carat Gold in the Iranian market using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The project is built upon the FinRL-Meta environment and evaluates the agent against the traditional Buy & Hold benchmark using real historical market data collected over the past decade.

The proposed system models the trading task as a sequential decision-making problem and demonstrates the capability of PPO to learn stable and profitable trading policies in a single-asset setting. Experimental results include portfolio growth analysis, action dynamics, daily return behavior, and risk-adjusted performance metrics.
